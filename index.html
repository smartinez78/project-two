        <p>I'm a second year undergraduate student at the Illinois Institute of Technology,
        studying Information Technology and Management. Born and raised in Chicago, I've
        decided to give back to my city by working at a non-profit organization for the
        past few months. I have interests in Web and Software Development as well as
        Cyber Security, with a passion for creating technologies that will give users
        the best experiences possible.</p>

        <p id="dog-description"> My dog is a four year old Jack-Russel Terrier mix named Edujives.
        You can call her Edu for short. Her nicknames include "Albondiga", which is
        Spanish for meatball. She likes to roll around on her towel after a bath, chew
        on her bed, and enjoys long walks around the neighborhood.
