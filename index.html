        <p class="para"> I'm a second year undergraduate student at the Illinois Institute of Technology,
            studying Information Technology and Management. Born and raised in Chicago, I've
            decided to give back to my city by working at a non-profit organization for the
            past few months.  I have interests in Web and Software Development as well as
            Cyber Security, with a passion for creating technologies that will give users
            the best experiences possible.

                        You can call her Edu for short. Her nicknames include "Albondiga", which is
                        Spanish for meatball. She likes to roll around on her towel after a bath, chew
                        on her bed, and enjoys 1AM walks around the neighborhood.

                              play Tic-Tac-Toe against either the CPU (randomized) or against another person.
                              The project relied on the console to print the current status of the game.
